# LipiLink: Translating Silence, Connecting Worlds

LipiLink is an innovative tool designed to bridge the communication gap for the deaf community. Our goal is to enable seamless translation of all types of audio inputs, including phone calls, YouTube videos, and other media, into sign language in real-time. IT is a complex system that uses NLTK, NLP models, SigML, and several other APIs to convert audio to text to ISL and then generate an avatar that uses the sigml for ISL gestures in real-time. 

## Features

- **Versatile Audio Input**: The tool is designed to handle various audio sources, ensuring comprehensive coverage for different types of media.
- **Easy to use Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for a seamless user experience.
- **Accuracy:** More accurate and consistent than competitors in the market.
- **Real-Time Translation**: With advanced AI and machine learning algorithms, LipiLink will deliver instantaneous translations, ensuring that users do not miss out on important conversations or information.
